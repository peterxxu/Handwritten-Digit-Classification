# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

With data preprocessing using PCA tranformation, it examines different sklearn ML models including 
1. logistic regression
2. SVM
3. KNN
4. Random Forests

Note: every major step is encapsulated in functions with customizable parameters for scalability
