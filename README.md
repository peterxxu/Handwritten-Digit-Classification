# handwritten-digit-classification
This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

With data preprocessing using PCA tranformation, it constructs different sklearn ML models including 
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. KNN
4. Random Forests

and selects the best model setups by examining he performance on testing data based on k-fold cross validation

Note: every major step is encapsulated in functions with customizable parameters for scalability
